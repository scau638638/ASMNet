Abstract

Crack detection is crucial for road maintenance and traffic safety. However, manually designed networks for crack segmentation require domain expertise and extensive experience, and often result in heavyweight models that fail to capture fine-scale crack features. To address these challenges, we proposed a neural architecture search
based approach that automatically and efficiently searches for lightweight models. First, we constructed a large-scale model search space by randomly combining all searched modules that are assembled from operator sequences. Second, we defined a diversity metric, which combined distance difference, computation difference, and operator sequence difference, to measure the difference between two models. By incorporating models with higher diversity into the model population, redundant evaluations of similar models were avoided, significantly improving search efficiency. The optimal model obtained through neural architecture search was termed ASMNet, where ’A’, ’S’, and ’M’ represented ’Automatic’, ’Search’, and ’Module’, respectively. Comprehensive evaluations on four public benchmark datasets demonstrate that ASMNet achieves state-of-the-art performance, with F1-scores of 93.35%, 96.92%, 95.37%, and 85.40%, and mIoU of 87.54%, 94.21%, 91.51%, and 76.17%  Furthermore, the FLOPs and Params of ASMNet are 12.78G and 2.76M respectively (only 9.9% and 8.9% of U-Net)
